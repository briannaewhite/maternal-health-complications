# maternal-health-complications

Models were created in this project with this scenario in mind: a patient walks into the ER, and you would like to see the probability of the patient having a maternal health complication and needs immediate attention. 

logistic_reg_mhc.ipynb consists of code training a Logistic Regression model to predict when a patient has a maternal health complication. 
knn_mhc consists of code training a K-nearest neighbor model to predict when a patient has a maternal health complication.
